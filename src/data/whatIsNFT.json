    "description": "Non-Fungible Tokens are the digital equivalent of owning cool things in the physical world, like sexy sneakers or a Van Gogh. Like them, NFTs are unique, non-interchangeable units of data stored on the blockchain. They are photos, videos, or audio. They provide public proof of authenticity or ownership. But that does not restrict the sharing or copying of the digital file. Welcome to the future of owning, flaunting and sharing things on the net!"
